# Vehicle Speed Estimation using Optical Flow

## Project Overview

This project focuses on estimating the speed of vehicles using optical flow techniques. Optical flow refers to the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene, caused by the relative motion between an observer and the scene. By analyzing these motion patterns, we aim to accurately estimate the speed of moving vehicles.

## Introduction

In this project, we employ optical flow methods to capture and analyze the movement of vehicles in a video feed. The main steps involved in the process include:
1. Capturing video frames.
2. Applying optical flow algorithms to detect motion.
3. Calculating vehicle speed based on the detected motion.

## Features

- **Real-time Speed Estimation**: Process video feeds in real-time to estimate vehicle speed.
- **Optical Flow Algorithms**: Utilize advanced optical flow techniques like Farneback, Lucas-Kanade, etc.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of vehicle speeds and motion vectors.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-speed-estimation.git
    cd vehicle-speed-estimation
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use this project:

1. **Prepare your video feed**: Ensure you have a video file or a real-time video feed ready.
2. **Run the script**: Execute the main script to start processing the video feed.
    ```sh
    python vel_LK_OF_V1_1.py --_input_file path/to/your/video.mp4
    ```
